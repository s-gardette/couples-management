# Household Management App - Development Tasks

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (Current Sprint)

### 🎯 **CRITICAL NEXT STEP:** Fix Frontend Tests to 100% Pass Rate

**Status:** 17/20 endpoints working (85% success) - Need to fix 5 HTMX partial endpoints

#### **URGENT TASKS:**
- [ ] **Debug HTMX Partial Authentication Issues**
  - Investigate why partials return 401 with valid auth tokens
  - Check cookie/header handling for HTMX requests
  - Verify partial route authentication middleware

- [ ] **Implement Missing Partial Endpoints** (Return 200, not 401)
  - [ ] `GET /partials/households/list` - Household list component  
  - [ ] `GET /partials/households/create` - Household creation form
  - [ ] `GET /partials/households/join` - Join household form
  - [ ] `GET /partials/expenses/recent` - Recent expenses widget
  - [ ] `GET /partials/expenses/create` - Expense creation form

- [ ] **Verify Test Coverage**
  - [ ] All 15 authenticated endpoints → 200 ✅
  - [ ] All 2 public endpoints → 200 ✅  
  - [ ] All 5 partial endpoints → 200 ❌ (currently 401)

**Success Criteria:** All 20 frontend endpoints return 200 ✅
